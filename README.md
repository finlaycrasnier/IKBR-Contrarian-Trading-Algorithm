# IKBR-Contrarian-Trading-Algorithm
A small contrarian trading algorithm I created whilst learning from a Udemy equity trading course. The strategy revolves around purchasing stocks which have a relatively 'low' daily return, and shorting stocks that have a relatively 'high' daily return in hope that they will return to their average value in the following days. Once this occurs, they can be sold for a profit. Comments explaining the programming and strategy in more detail be found in the Python file.  


###Problems with the strategy

For personal development, I thought up of some potential problems with using such a strategy:

-not specific to DJIA
-no fundamental analysis (e.g if a stock declined because of poor earnings)
-no ‘safety net’ (if all stocks decline)
- could weight ups and downs

how I would improve this strategy
