# IKBR-Contrarian-Trading-Algorithm
A small contrarian trading algorithm I created whilst learning from a Udemy equity trading course.


###Problems with the strategy

For personal development, I thought up of some potential problems with using such a strategy:

-not specific to DJIA
-no fundamental analysis (e.g if a stock declined because of poor earnings)
-no ‘safety net’ (if all stocks decline)
- could weight ups and downs

how I would improve this strategy
